### Table
First, select a table to insert a row into. This can be done either by selecting a table from the pick list, or toggling the input field to text mode and typing the full table name.

### Columns
Next, map the datapills from your previous triggers or actions into their respective columns. The columns in the selected table are presented as input fields here for you to insert datapills.
