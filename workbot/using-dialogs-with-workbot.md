# Using Dialogs with Workbot
Workbot can be used to invoke [Slack Dialogs](https://api.slack.com/dialogs); an awesome Slack feature that allows you to elicit info in a more interactive way.

Workbot can invoke dialogs to, say, collect info from a user to open a ticket in Github, amongst other things.

## Concept
To create a dialog workflow, you need 3 recipes to perform 3 high-level functions:
1. **Trigger a post dialog recipe**
When triggered, the action in this recipe ***triggers*** the second recipe which in turn invokes the dialog. We'll call this the **Trigger recipe**.

2. **Post dialog**
When triggered, the action in this recipe ***posts*** the dialog.

3. **Execute actions**
When the dialog is submitted, the actions in this recipe ***executes*** the follow-up actions.

![Dialog diagram](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/anatomy-of-a-dialog.png)

From a recipe standpoint, the first recipe triggers the **Trigger recipe**, which in turn triggers the **Execute actions** recipe.

This is because invoking dialogs requires `Trigger ID`, something that's only generated from button or menu option click events on Slack.

Check out these simple recipes to see dialogs in action: [Trigger recipe](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673215-1-invoke-dialog#recipe), [Post dialog](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673218-2-configure-dialog#recipe), and [Execute actions](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673219-3-actions#recipe)

### Triggering a post dialog recipe

To trigger a post dialog recipe, use either the **Post command reply** or **Post message** Workbot actions.

Regardless of which Workbot action you choose, the dialog recipe can be triggered via 2 methods:

#### 1. Buttons

![Buttons](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/invoke-with-buttons.png)

The **Submit button command** field is especially important - this command will trigger the recipe that posts the dialog (i.e. the **Trigger recipe**).

![Submit button command](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/submit-button-command.png)

#### 2. Menu options

![Menu options](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/invoke-with-menu-options.png)

The **Submit menu option command** field is especially important - this command will trigger the recipe that posts the dialog (i.e. the **Trigger recipe**)

![Submit menu option command](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/submit-menu-option-command.png)

Clicking either buttons or menu options in Slack triggers an event that comes with a `Trigger ID`, a parameter necessary for invoking dialogs.

In the example above, both the button and the menu option sends a Workbot command to `collect issue details`.

### Posting a dialog
To ensure that the dialog in this recipe is the one to be invoked, the submit button or menu option commands in the **Trigger recipe** must map to the **Post command** trigger in this post dialog recipe.

![Mapping invocation with dialog](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/mapping-invocation-to-dialog.png)

The **Post dialog** recipe uses the Workbot **Post command** trigger to receive commands from the buttons or menu options in the **trigger** recipe.

In this example **Post dialog** [recipe](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673218-2-configure-dialog#jobs), both the submit button and submit menu option commands `collect issue details` are identical to the **Post dialog** trigger `collect issue details`.

#### Setting up the post dialog
Use the **Post dialog** action to set up the post dialog.

The following table lists the available fields in the **Post dialog** action.

<table class="unchanged rich-diff-level-one">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Explanation</th>
            <th>What goes in here</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Trigger ID</td>
            <td>The ID of a submit button or submit menu option triggered event.
            </td>
            <td>Use the <kbd>Trigger ID</kbd> pill from <b>Post command</b> trigger.
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Callback ID</td>
            <td>
              Identifier for the dialog. Maximum length of 255 characters.
            </td>
            <td>
            Pass command input values from the <b>Submit button</b> or <b>Submit menu option</b> commands defined in the trigger recipe. <img src="/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/button-command-input-values.png"></img><img src="/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/menu-option-command-input-values.png"></img> <br><br>Ensure that the parameter names in the trigger recipe match the command input fields in the recipe that <i>posts</i> the dialog.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dialog title</td>
            <td>The title of the invoked dialog. Maximum length of 24 characters.</td>
            <td>
              Explain the purpose of the dialog, e.g.<br><br> <i>Create a ticket</i><br><br>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Submit button label</td>
            <td>
              Text label to display on the dialog <b>Submit</b> button. Single word input only.
            </td>
            <td>Defaults to <b>Submit</b> when left blank. All dialogs will have a <b>Cancel</b> button by default.<img src="/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/default-dialog-submit-cancel.png"></img>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Submit button command</td>
            <td>Workbot command to execute when Slack user clicks on the <b>Submit</b> button in the dialog
            </td>
            <td>Use a Workbot command that matches the <b>Post command</b> trigger of the recipe to execute.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Dialog form fields</td>
            <td>
            this will be <b>automatically</b> generated upon selecting a command in <b>Submit button command</b> input field. Max of 5 fields</td>
            <td>
              This defines the fields that appear in the dialog. <br><br>Modify this to include hints, error handling, picklist options, etc. for your dialog.<br><br>Do not change the "name" values as they should match that of the command input fields of the recipe executed from the <b>Submit button command</b> above. See the example JSON from the <b>Post dialog</b> <a href='https://www.workato.com/recipes/673218-2-configure-dialog#recipe'> recipe.
            </td>
    </tbody>
</table>

The **Submit button command** field is especially important - this command will trigger the recipe that executes the actions (i.e. the Execute actions recipe).

### Executing actions

To ensure that this recipe is the one to be executed by the dialog, the submit button command in the **Post dialog** recipe must map to this recipe's **Post command** trigger.

![Mapping dialog to another recipe](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/mapping-dialog-to-another-recipe.png)

The last recipe (responsible for executing follow-up actions) uses the Workbot **Post command** trigger to receive commands from the submit button command in the **Post dialog** recipe.

In this example, the **Post dialog** [recipe's](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673218-2-configure-dialog#recipe) submit button command `github new issue` is identical to the **Execute actions** [recipe's](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673219-3-actions#recipe) **Post command** trigger `github new issue`.

## Common pitfalls when using dialogs
Given that dialogs involve using multiple recipes, it's normal to encounter some issues at the start. Here are some common pitfalls when using dialogs.

### 1. Using the same Post command trigger words on more than 1 recipe.

![App, action, action data](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-dialogs/app-action-actiondata.png)

Ensure that the combination of all 3 **App**, **Action**, and **Action data** of Post command triggers in any of your recipes are unique across your Workato account. Any submit button or submit menu option command should only be mapped to 1 recipe.

For example, the recipe above should be the only recipe in that Workato account to have `github report bug` as its Post command trigger.

### 2. Submit button / menu option commands incorrectly mapped
Ensure that the **Submit button command** and/or **Submit menu option command** of a recipe is correctly mapped to the Post command trigger of the secondary (or tertiary) recipe.

### 3. Incorrect mapping of dialog form fields with command input fields of subsequently triggered recipe
Ensure that dialog form field names from the **Post dialog** recipe correspond with the command input fields of the subsequently triggered recipe.

## Try it out!
Try dialogs out by adding these example **[Trigger recipe](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673215-1-invoke-dialog#recipe)**, **[Post dialog](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673218-2-configure-dialog#recipe)** and **[Execute actions](https://www.workato.com/recipes/673219-3-actions#recipe)** recipes, invoking them from Slack.
