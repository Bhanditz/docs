# What are custom bots?
Custom bots are Slack apps you can use together with Workato for triggers and/or actions. They're useful for when you want to customize your bot for specific functions; giving it a name related to that function, as well as giving it its own icon e.g. HRBot, SupportBot. This allows you greater flexibility in customizing your bot's functionalities and identity.

### Creating a custom bot
To get started, head to Tools ➤ Workbot like so:

![Tools > Workbot](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/tools-workbot.png)*If you don't see Workbot, make sure your Workato team or account has access to Workbot*
Under the **Custom** tab, click on **Create a custom bot**.

![Create a custom bot](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/create-custom-bot.png)*If you don't see the **Custom** tab, make sure your Workato team or account has access to Custom OAuth profiles*

In Step 1, click on **Create new app**.

This will open a new tab that brings you to https://api.slack.com/apps. Keep both the Workato tab and this new tab open - you'll need both to complete Steps 2 and 3.

Sign in to your team (if you haven't already), then click on **Create New App**.

In the form that pops up, give your bot a name - it typically describes the functionality of the bot e.g. HRBot or SupportBot.

Choose which Slack team this custom bot belongs to, then click on **Create App**.

Your custom bot should now be created! You should be greeted with your new bot's **Basic Information** page. If not - don't sweat it. Just click on **Basic Information** from the left navigation menu.

Scroll down to **App Credentials** you'll need this information back on your Workato tab. With this info handy, we can now head back to the Workato tab to complete Step 2.

In Step 2, fill up:
- **Name**: This should be the same name you used to name your custom bot when creating the app e.g. HRBot
- **Client ID**
- **Client secret**
- **Verification token**

It should look like this:

![App credentials](/assets/images/workbot/workbot-slash-commands/app-credentials-workato.png)

Hit **Save** once you're done. We can now configure your custom bot to talk to Workato in Step 3.

### Configuring your custom bot to talk to Workato
Now that your custom bot has been created, we'll need to configure it to be able to talk to Workato. Step 3 is done completely on your app page on Slack, so let's head back to the Slack tab (you kept it open, right?).

Don't fret if you didn't - you can always head to Tools ➤ Workbot ➤ Custom, and clicking on your custom bot:

#### Setting up OAuth & Permissions
You'll want to allow your custom bot to perform certain functions in your Slack team - so you'll need to set some scopes and permissions for it. On your app page on Slack, from the left navigation menu under **Features**, head over to **OAuth & Permissions**.

Scroll down to **Redirect URLs** and click on **Add a new Redirect URL**. Copy and add this URL:<br><br> <code>https://www.workato.com/oauth/callback</code><br>

If you get an error like the one below, make sure there are no extra spaces at the start/end of the link. Once you're done, remember to hit **Save URLs**.

Scroll down to **Scopes**, and select the following **Permission Scopes**:
- bot

#### Adding the custom bot as a user in your Slack team
You'll want to add your custom bot to your team so it can interact with users in a more conversational manner. From the left navigation menu, under **Features**, head over to **Bot Users** and click on **Add a Bot User**.

- Set the **Display name** and **Default username** as the name of your bot e.g. **HRBot**
- Set **Always Show My Bot as Online** to `ON`
- Click on Add Bot User
