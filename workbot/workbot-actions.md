# Workato actions for Slack
Workbot actions allow Workbot to post notifications into a specified channel when there are events to take note of, or respond to a command.

Workbot supports 3 actions:
* [Post command reply](#post-command-reply)
* [Post notifications](#post-notifications)
* [Post messages](#post-messages)
* [Download attachment](#download-attachment)

## Post command reply
Post command reply allows you to customize how Workbot replies when an event is completed. This reply can be a simple message about the task completion, or a prompt for the user to take a subsequent action once the first has been done, e.g. after retrieving data for a custom account in Salesforce, ask if the user wishes to copy that information across to another application.

Here is what the Post Command Reply action's output will look like in Slack.

## Post messages
This action will post a message response to a user who invokes a command. By default, Workbot posts direct messages only to the user who installed Workbot. Note, it is also possible to subscribe from a channel (where Workbot participates) to these notifications.

The fields available are simillar to that of the **Post command reply** action, with all the typical fields you see in a Slack message. However, there is the advanced section with 2 fields: **Message to update** and **Thread ID**.

**Message to update** allows you to overwrite a previously posted message from an earlier action step. Simply use the <code>Message ID</code> datapill from a **Post message** or **Post notification** output datatree.

*Message to update example*

**Thread ID** allows you to post a message within an existing thread in Slack. Simply use the <code>Thread ID</code> datapill from a **Post message** or **Post notification** output datatree.

## Post notifications
This action allows you to define which Slack channel to post customized notifications to. By default, Workbot posts direct messages only to the user who installed Workbot. Note, it is also possible to subscribe from a channel (where Workbot participates) to these notifications.

The fields available are simillar to that of the **Post command reply** action, with all the typical fields you see in a Slack message. However, there is the addition of the field **Notification filter**. This field allows you to set parameters for filters, which acts like a trigger filter for sending out notifications (i.e. the notification will only get sent when the set criteria is met).

## Download attachment
This action allows you to download attachments from Slack, received as input to [**New command** trigger](workbot-triggers.md#new-commands-building-custom-commands). Make sure command parameter for uploaded content has type *file*, e.g. `attachment type:file`. Pass file URL from **New command** output into the **URL** field to get attachment content. Then you may further pass this file content to Dropbox, Box or other connectors to upload them as files.
