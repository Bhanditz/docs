# Running recipes
This section covers recipe management - what you need to know in order to handle testing (i.e. fetching a single trigger event), starting and stopping a recipe.

This section also covers jobs management - how to read your jobs report for troubleshooting and debugging, as well as how to customize your jobs report to get the most relevant data.
