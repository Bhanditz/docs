## Extensions
Enterprises often have on-premises applications and databases that are deployed behind a corporate firewall.

Workato’s On-prem extensions allows you to connect to legacy applications using Java. Extensions are registered as Servlets in the Workato On-Premise Agent, and expose as REST endpoints which can be used from within a recipe.

When to use this:
- Application does not have REST / SOAP APIs.
- Application has a supported Java library.

When not to use this:
- Application has REST / SOAP APIs. Use the [HTTP Connector](/developing-connectors/http-v2.md) or build a customer connection with the [Connector SDK](/developing-connectors/sdk.md).
- You want to execute simple command-line scripts. Use [Command-line scripts](#command-line-scripts-profile) instead.

### Pre-requisites:
[Java 8 SDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

### Example
To explain Extensions, we'll walkthrough how to create a simple extension that performs a SHA-256 message digest. This extension takes the request body and returns a SHA-256 encrypted version of it. We will then enable it as a REST endpoint so that you can use this extension in a recipe.

#### Build Extension
Download the [repository](https://github.com/workato/opa-extensions) for this extension. This is a Gradle project which will serve as a base template that you can leverage on to write your own extensions.

The source file for the On-prem extension is located in
`src/main/java/com/mycompany/onprem/SecurityExtension.java`

Run `./gradlew jar` on the root folder to bootstrap Gradle and build the project. You will find the output in `build/libs/opa-extensions-0.1.jar`

#### Install Extension
To install the OPA extension, create a new directory called `ext` under the Workato agent directory and place `opa-extensions-0.1.jar` in the `ext` folder. Your directory should look like this:

![OPA Directory](/assets/images/on-prem/opa_directory.png)

Update `conf/config.yml` with the classpath and newly added extension. This tells the on-prem agent where to find the jar files:
```YAML
server:
  classpath: C:\\Program Files\\Workato Agent\\ext
extensions:
  security:
    controllerClass: com.mycompany.onprem.SecurityExtension
    secret: HA63A3043AMMMM
```
Note that the `classpath` value above should be set to the appropriate location, which may differ in your environment.

If you have multiple extensions, place all jar files in the ext folder and add a new entry under extensions:
```YAML
server:
  classpath: C:\\Program Files\\Workato Agent\\ext
extensions:
  security:
    controllerClass: com.mycompany.onprem.SecurityExtension
    secret: HA63A3043AMMMM
  otherextension:
    controllerClass: com.mycompany.onprem.OtherExtension
```
The **server** parameter configuration property is as follows:

| Property name | Description |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| classpath | Specifies the location of user-defined class |

<br>

The **extensions** parameter configuration properties are as follows:

| Property name | Description |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| security | This is the extension profile name that will be used in the SDK. Use a unique name for each extension. |
| controllerClass | A required field to inform the OPA which Java class to map the extension to. |
| secret | Optional environment property that is used in the Java class. Multiple properties can be added. |

#### Build SDK
In order to use the extension in a recipe, we need a custom connector (SDK) in Workato.
Create an custom connector in the [Connectors page](https://www.workato.com/custom_adapters) with the following code:
```ruby
{
  title: 'On-prem security',
  secure_tunnel: true,

  connection: {
    fields: [{ name: 'profile', hint: 'On-prem security connection profile' }],
    authorization: { type: 'none'},
    apply: ->() {
      headers('X-Workato-Connector': 'enforce')
    }
  },

  test: ->(connection) {
    post("http://localhost/ext/#{connection['profile']}/computeDigest", { payload: 'test' })
  },

  actions: {
    sha256_digest: {
      title: 'Create SHA-256 digest',
      description: 'Create <span class="provider">SHA-256</span> digest',

      input_fields: -> { [{ name: 'payload' }] },
      output_fields: -> { [{name: 'signature' }] },

      execute: ->(connection, input) {
        post("http://localhost/ext/#{connection['profile']}/computeDigest", input)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Take note of the following in the SDK code:
- `secure_tunnel` is set to true which allows you to select an OPA when creating a connection. Make sure to select the OPA that has the extension.

- Header `X-Workato-Connector: enforce` is used to inform the OPA that this is a request to communicate with the OPA extension

- The path `http://localhost/ext/#{connection['profile']}/computeDigest` is defined in the Java class
```java
@RequestMapping(path = "/computeDigest", method = RequestMethod.POST)
```
