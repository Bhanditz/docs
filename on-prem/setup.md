5) Run the agent installer and follow the installation instructions.
6) By default, the agent is installed into `C:\Program Files\Workato Agent` folder and a `Workato` group is created in the Start Menu.
7) During the installation, you can choose to install a Windows service called `WorkatoAgent`.
8) Unzip the `cert.zip` file and move the contents (`cert.key` and `cert.pem`) to `C:\Program Files\Workato Agent/conf` directory. It should be in the same folder as the sample `config.yml` file.

An installation instruction video for Windows is also available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu3GCk7OY6Q&feature=youtu.be).
