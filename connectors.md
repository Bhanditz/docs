# Connectors
This section contains documentation on the connectors supported on the Workato platform, covering aspects such as:

- API version
- Supported editions and versions
- How to connect to the connector on Workato
- Roles and permissions required to connect
- Details on using the triggers
- Details on using the actions
- Troubleshooting the common errors

This documentation does not comprehensively cover all our connectors. We're constantly building new connectors and adding to the documentation. Let us know if there's any connector in particular you'd like to see covered, and you can always help to add to our documentation!
